# RePaperLab
This repository contains re-implementations and experiments inspired by key research papers in the domain of deep learning for smart agriculture. The focus is on the detection and classification of wheat diseases using advanced techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
## Overview
This project implements the approach proposed in the following research papers:

1. **[Improving Wheat Leaf Disease Classification: Evaluating Augmentation Strategies and CNN-Based Models With Limited Dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10521470)**  
   This paper evaluates augmentation strategies and CNN-based models for wheat leaf disease classification with limited datasets.

2. **[An In-field Automatic Wheat Disease Diagnosis System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08299)**  
   This paper proposes an automatic system for in-field wheat disease diagnosis using advanced image analysis techniques.

3. **[Image-based Wheat Fungi Diseases Identification by Deep Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/10/8/1500)**  
   This research identifies wheat fungi diseases using image-based deep learning methods.

4. **[Real-Time Plant Disease Dataset Development and Detection of Plant Disease Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10414062)**  
   This paper focuses on the development of a real-time plant disease dataset and disease detection using deep learning techniques.
